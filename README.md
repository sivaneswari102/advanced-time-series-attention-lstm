- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Baseline LSTM forecasting
- Attention-based LSTM forecasting
- RMSE performance comparison

## Results
The attention-based model achieved better performance and provided
interpretability through attention weights.

## Tools
Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
